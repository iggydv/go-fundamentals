# Expanding on Message Queues and Alternatives

Here's a breakdown of how polling and WebSockets fit into the picture, along with their comparisons to message queues:

## 1. Polling

### **How it works:**

The client periodically sends requests to the server to check for new data.
The server responds with the latest data (or an indication that there's no new data).

### Tradeoffs:
- **Pros:** Simple to implement.
- **Cons:** Inefficient (wastes bandwidth and server resources when there's no new data), high latency (delays between polls), not truly real-time.
- **Use Cases:**
    Simple applications where near real-time updates are not critical.
    Situations where server-side push is not feasible. 
- **Comparison to Message Queues**:
    Polling is a client-driven approach, whereas message queues are server-driven.
    Message queues provide asynchronous, reliable delivery, while polling is synchronous and prone to data loss if requests fail. 
    Message queues are far more efficient in almost all cases.

## 2. WebSockets

### How it works:

Establishes a persistent, bidirectional connection between the client and server.
Allows real-time communication in both directions.

### Tradeoffs:

- **Pros**: Real-time, low latency, efficient for bidirectional communication.
- **Cons**: More complex to implement than polling, requires maintaining persistent connections, can be resource-intensive
  for a large number of concurrent connections.
- **Use Cases**:
    Chat applications, online gaming, real-time dashboards, collaborative editing.
- **Comparison to Message Queues**:
    WebSockets are for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
    Message queues are for asynchronous, reliable communication between different services or components within a system.
    Websockets are for client to server or server to client communications. Message queues are for server to server
    communications, or application component to application component communications.
    Websockets maintain a connection. Message queues do not.
    Websockets are more for application level communication, message queues are used for system level communication.
    Relationship to Message Queues

## WebSockets and message queues can be used together. 
### For example:
A message queue might be used to distribute real-time updates from a backend service.
A WebSocket server could then subscribe to the message queue and push the updates to connected clients.
A message queue might be used to distribute messages between backend services, and then a backend service could use
websockets to communicate to a client.

In this scenario, the message queue provides reliable, asynchronous delivery, while WebSockets provide real-time
communication to the user interface.
Key Takeaways

Polling is generally considered a less desirable approach compared to message queues or WebSockets for real-time
communication.
WebSockets are excellent for real-time, bidirectional communication with clients.
Message queues are very effective for server to server, and internal application communications.
Message queues and websockets can be used together to create very robust and highly scalable systems.
